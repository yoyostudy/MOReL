# Model Based Offline Reinforcement Learning Methods
This repository is my coursework project for the reinforcement learning course @ SFU CMPT729.

I modified the code from [an existing implementation of MOReL.](https://github.com/SwapnilPande/MOReL) to fit the offline RL dataset.
My dataset is sourced from [NeoRL](https://github.com/polixir/NeoRL). They also provide an online simulator for evaluating.
